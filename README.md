# RAG-System-in-Azure
RAG is a method that combines a retrieval mechanism with a generative language model to enhance the relevance of AI-generated responses. In this project,  I integrate Azure OpenAI into a Python-based application, retrieve relevant documents using a vector database and enhance generative AI outputs by combining retrieved data with model-generated responses.
